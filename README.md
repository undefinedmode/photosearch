# photosearch
Script to find photo's on a drive (by filename notation) and copy/move them to a another folder. Very useful for people who have had camera's from multiple vendors over the years.
  
##Copy script to the drive and simply run
  
    ./photosearch.sh
    
##Known bugs
* Move option will overwrite files with identical names
